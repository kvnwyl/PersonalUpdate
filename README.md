# Personal Update :thumbsup:

I have created this repo as a temporary store for me to drop some quick updates in a blog post format.

## Where Have I Been

I know it's been a little while since I last posted on social media or updated projects on github so you might be asking yourself "Hey Kev, where have you been?" and you'd be quite right to ask that question.

The truth is I have been working on a lot of personal projects and getting things right for my workflow - I have been around, albeit silently. I will look to upload some stuff soon though :smile:

## Personal Projects

Here are a few of the personal projects I have been working on when I am happy to share some details about:

- Creating a DIY NAS setup using Raspberry Pi 4, portable hard drives and OMV.
- Creating a DIY macro keyboard setup allowing me to create and customise hotkeys to automate a variety of different tasks.

## Coming Soon / Future Plans

- At some point in the future I am going to look to establish my own website / blog so I don't have to communicate updates in this form.
- When my hotkey configuration is complete, I will look to upload all scripts which I currently use and instructions on how to configure. This will act as a reference for me but will also hopefully be useful for others.

I will look to hopefully get some of these future plans in place soon and keep you all updated with how things are progressing.
